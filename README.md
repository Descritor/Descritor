- 👋 Hi, I’m @Descritor
  
- 😊 I’m interested in developing and learning to code software to make previously popular and non functional mobile games better!
  
- 📖 I’m currently studying source code through decompiled .apk through dev apps to understand how processes works.
  
- 💁‍♂️ I’m looking for help to see if people could help me pull source information and to guide me through engine building.
  
- 📫 You can contact me via email at eragon1445@gmail.com

- 💫 Fun fact: When Otters fall asleep, they hold each others hands to keep from drifting apart.
